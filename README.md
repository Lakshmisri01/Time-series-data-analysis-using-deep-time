# Time-series-data-analysis-using-deep-time
This project, explores advanced time series analysis techniques using the "deep time" Python library. The approach includes dimension reduction, clustering, and Markov models to deeply analyze fluctuations in gold prices, providing insights into economic and geopolitical impacts. Techniques such as PCA, TICA, VAMP, and Hidden Markov Models are applied to uncover underlying patterns, detect anomalies, and forecast future trends. 

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the "Gold Price USD," which chronicles the daily market prices of gold in US dollars. Data points date back to January 1, 2008, providing a rich historical context to analyze trends and fluctuations. Each record consists of two main features: the date of recording and the gold price on that date. 

## Methodology
The project employs a variety of time series analysis techniques to study the "Gold Price USD" dataset. **Rolling Statistics** are calculated to smooth out short-term fluctuations and reveal longer-term trends by observing moving averages and standard deviations. **Exponential Smoothing** is utilized to forecast future values effectively, accommodating changes in trends flexibly. The **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test** assesses the stationarity of the series, essential for ensuring the validity of subsequent analyses and forecasts. **Time Series Decomposition** breaks the data into trend, seasonality, and residuals, providing a clearer understanding of each component's influence on gold price movements. **Anomaly Detection** identifies outliers, which are crucial for recognizing significant deviations that might indicate market disruptions. Lastly, **Advanced Decomposition Algorithms**, such as STL decomposition, are implemented to handle more complex patterns, allowing for a more detailed dissection of the time series data. All methods together forge a robust framework for analyzing the dataset, enabling the detection of underlying patterns and the prediction of future price movements.
